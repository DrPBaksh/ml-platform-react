## 🎯 Usage Guide

### 1. Upload Data
- Drag and drop a CSV file or click to browse
- The system validates data quality and shows warnings
- Preview your data before proceeding

### 2. Select Columns
- Choose predictor variables (features)
- Select target variable (what to predict)
- Get smart recommendations based on data types

### 3. Explore Data
- View distributions and correlations
- Identify data quality issues
- Revise column selections if needed

### 4. Preprocessing
- Automatic encoding of categorical variables
- Scaling of numerical features
- Handle missing values

### 5. Train/Test Split
- Interactive slider to set split ratio
- Option for stratified sampling
- Visual representation of split

### 6. Model Training
- Configure regularization (L1/L2)
- View coefficient importance
- Real-time training progress

### 7. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Performance interpretation

### 8. Make Predictions
- Upload new CSV data
- Get predictions with confidence scores
- Download results

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors
The app uses a carefully crafted color palette defined in `tailwind.config.js`:
- Primary: Blue tones for actions and emphasis
- Gray: Neutral tones for text and backgrounds
- Success: Green for positive states
- Warning: Yellow for warnings
- Error: Red for errors

### Animations
Custom animations are defined in the Tailwind config:
- `fade-in` - Smooth opacity transitions
- `slide-up` - Upward motion effects
- `pulse-soft` - Gentle pulsing for loading states

### Components
All components use consistent design patterns:
- `card` - Base container with rounded corners and shadow
- `card-interactive` - Hoverable cards with scale effects
- `btn-primary` - Primary action buttons
- `btn-secondary` - Secondary action buttons
- `input-field` - Form inputs with focus states

## 🧪 Development

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm start          # Start development server
npm test           # Run test suite
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run eject      # Eject from Create React App (not recommended)
```

### Development Guidelines
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Use hooks for state management
- Implement responsive design first
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Include error handling for all user inputs
- Write descriptive component and function names

### Adding New ML Models
To add a new machine learning model:

1. Create a new folder in `src/components/` (e.g., `LinearRegression/`)
2. Implement the step-by-step workflow components
3. Add the model to the hero section in `Hero.js`
4. Update the main app routing in `App.js`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Netlify (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `build`
4. Deploy automatically on git push

### Vercel
1. Import your GitHub repository
2. Vercel auto-detects React and configures build settings
3. Deploy with one click

### AWS S3 + CloudFront
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload `build` folder contents to S3 bucket
3. Configure CloudFront for SPA routing
4. Set up custom domain if needed

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- All data processing happens in the browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- CSV files are processed locally using Papa Parse
- No persistent storage of user data

### Disclaimers
- For demonstration purposes only
- Not suitable for production use with sensitive data
- Users should validate all results independently
